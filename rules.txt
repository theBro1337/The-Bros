Hello members

Here are the few rules that you need to follow

1.You have to help the other members of the group . I am not talking about 
helping to solve ctf or remove bugs . I am taling about helping with malwares 
and helping the bros out when he/she is in trouble or during hacking. For example .
2. There will be a messenger in which we will chat and hangout . It will use symmetric encryption . So there will be one password for encryption and message databases . Don't forget it .
3.Anyone who is doing a job can donate if u are not doing any job or don't have any income source don't need to donateb . The donation can be as less
as 1$ . It is to pay for our servers . 
4.You can share/sell/trade your code,exploits,malware if its open source . We don't accept closed source here
5. Anyone who does OSINT should share informations/intelligence with other members
Thats all . The rules can be updated
